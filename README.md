This is a comprehensive repository with over **29 000** curated phishing and scam domains that appear on the Discord platform. 

We provide lists of malicious domains to server owners to safeguard their members from malicious links and researchers that investigate these threats.

The database is actively maintained by [akac](https://github.com/actually-akac) & [ThinLiquid](https://github.com/ThinLiquid).<br>

*Note:* We only add apex domains if the entire domain was registered in bad faith. Some of the domains have already been taken down by the respective domain registrars.
